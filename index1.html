<FONT SIZE=7> Welcome to my BTT101 CPT!
<P> <center> <font color="pink"> 
<FONT SIZE=5> My name is Arianna and this is my  first E-Portfolio as a freshman in high school!
<P> <font color="black"> 
<FONT SIZE=4> In this webpage, 
I will present to you all of the skills 
I have learned in this course. 
first, some things about myself;
I am a grade 9 student at St.Edmund Campion. 
My hobbies include things like playing sports, listening to music and more teen hobbies. 
I work well with others and I enjoy working on projects.
I am responsible, intuitive and a good thinker. 
In the short time we have spent in this class, I met many amazing friends. 
I enjoyed learning together with these people. 
Learning useful things such as spreadsheet skills, coding skills, etc
will forever be something I am going to use in life. 
Hopefully these skills that I learned in my business course will make me stand out for this job position!
